# Brizoler

30/06/2015

	I was watching a HandMade hero video and coding along with it.
When it finished, I started messing around with a function that wrote at the display
buffer and kinda created an interesting animated pattern in the screen. Later, I
started this same code on linux using SDL making the same math patterns 
as a stoner enterteinment joke and end up with others effects as well.
But these days I had this idea of making brizoler into a real application.
It would work as a host, where the plugins would be visual effects or filters,
where you could output into a display or maybe lights in a gig.
In the UI it would be possible to route data from one plug-in to another,
doubling or converging paths. Its a very similar idea to MOD audio processor
UI, but in a visual context.
